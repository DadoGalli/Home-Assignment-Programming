This is a home assignment for the course 'Programming for Psychologists' from the Research Master Cognitive Neuropsychology at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. In this assignment, I needed to visualize fMRI data to show the strength of the association between specific brain areas and a certain cognitive concept (in this case: Anxiety). This tested my knowledge and skills on the visualization, handling and interpretation of data and coding efficiency.

**anxiety_uniformity-test_z_FDR_0.01.nii.gz** is the functional fMRI data file
